          <h4><strong>My life before Epicodus:</strong></h4>

          <p>Mornings are tough. It takes me a while to get up. Iâ€™m woken early every morning by my neighbor, who lives above me. She stomps back and forth across her floor. I lay in bed, awake, and try not to listen. When she leaves, I go back to sleep.</p>

          <p>I work in a restaurant, which makes me sociopathic; I periodically decide which bridge would be most suitable in offering me a swift exit. By spending countless hours communicating with scores of strangers, I have been near stripped of my confidence in mankind.</p>

          <p>I have lived in Oklahoma, Texas, California, New York, France, and now Oregon. The word <em>gypsy</em> comes to mind. What can I say? Oklahoma felt like a cage. When I could, I went as far as my legs would carry me.</P>

          <h4><strong>Now an Epicodus Student:</strong></h4>

          <p>I wake each day at six in the morning. I can count on my fingers and toes how many times I have woken up at six in the morning over the last ten years. You know what, <span class="special"><strong>I love it.</strong></span></p>

        <h4><strong>What I have done so far:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/TavishOKeefe/Animal-Shelter">Animal-Shelter</a></li>
            <p>This project contains HTML, CSS, and a bit of BootStrap code. It is meant to represent an animal shelter, and a variety of dogs up for adoption. We list their weight, breed, and age.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/TavishOKeefe/wiki">Wikipedia</a></li>
            <p>This project contains HTML, CSS, and a bit of BootStrap code. It is meant to be an attempt at recreating the Wikipedia home page. If one were to look at the Wikipedia home page, and then at our page, there would be a stark contrast. It's my first week coding- give me a break.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/TavishOKeefe/vacation-2-practice">Vacation Destinations</a></li>
            <p>This project contains HTML, CSS, and a bit of BootStrap code. It is meant to represent some vacation destinations, their prices, and activities which can be done upon arrival. I've heard of this thing people call a vacation- I plan to research more on what exactly it is, and how people find time to do it.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/TavishOKeefe/Chopin">Chopin</a></li>
            <p>This project contains HTML, CSS, and a bit of BootStrap code. It is meant to pay homage to a band, or artist we respect. In this case, Chopin. We have incorporated picutures and text representing the artist in his truest form.</p>

      <h4><strong>Writting:</strong></h4>

      <p>I resently completed my first novel, entitled, <em>Big Pond Fish</em>. It is a gritty novel set in New York City, recent past, which follows the life of Dillinger, a mid twenties renegade, who's apprehension at joining the corporate world, causes him to fall into a life of drug distribution and organized crime.</p>

      <p>Dillinger is introduced to the nightlife of New York City, and the money which can be made by satisfying the ravenous hunger of the youth's quest for distractions. But, there is a mysterious nature to his encounters, and he is in a constant state of question. He begins to drown his anxiety with intoxicants, and gains temporary relief. However, as time progresses, the Shadows, personifications of his growing addictions, and a bridge between the physical and metaphysical word, begin to take form, and affect not only his business, but his perception of reality.</p>

      <p>Big Pond Fish glamorizes entertainment, material possessions, and everything used to fill the voids carried by the lost. It takes the reader to the pinnacle of mass desire, then reveals the frivolity, and darkness which surrounds indulgence.</p>

      <p>Grounded through intellectual conversations, progressed by moments of confrontation, and captivating through touches of the surreal, Big Pond Fish is a thrilling read, with an ending no one will expect.</p>

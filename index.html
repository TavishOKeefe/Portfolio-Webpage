      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <h4>Pre Epicodus</h4>

      <p>Mornings are tough. It takes me a while to get up. Iâ€™m woken early every morning by my neighbor, who lives above me. She stomps back and forth across her floor. I lay in bed, awake, and try not to listen. When she leaves, I go back to sleep.</p>

      <p>I work in a restaurant, which makes me sociopathic; I periodically decide which bridge would be most suitable in offering me a swift exit. By spending countless hours communicating with scores of strangers, I have been near stripped of my confidence in mankind.</p>

      <p>I have lived in Oklahoma, Texas, California, New York, France, and now Oregon. The word <em>gypsy</em> comes to mind. What can I say? Oklahoma felt like a cage. When I could, I went as far as my legs would carry me- no thats not true; I flew, or drove, or took public transit</P>

      <h4>Now an Epicodus Student</h4>

      <p>I wake each day at six in the morning. I can count on my fingers and toes how many times I have woken up at six in the morning over the last ten years- before Epicodus. You know what, <strong>I love it.</strong></p>
